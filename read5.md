## CSS
### Color
* **Foreground Color**:  specify the color of text inside an element, you can specify any color by *RGB Values* or by *HEX Codes*
or by *Color Names*
* **background-color**: CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.
You can specify your
background color in the same way you can specify foreground colors
* **Choosing a color** : Color pickers can help you find the color you want.and It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color
