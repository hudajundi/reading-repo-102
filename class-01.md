## HTML
### Introduction
* **How the web works**
When the is visited, the browser will first connect to a DNS *Domain Name System* server;  it tells the computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name. then it to contact the web server
that hosts the website you
requested. A web server is a
computer that is constantly
connected to the web, and is set
up especially to send web pages
to users. The web server then sends the
page you requested back to your
web browser.
### Structure
* HTML uses elements to describe the structure of pages. each element in HTML has an opening tag and a closing tag. 
* Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
separated by an equals sign.
* HTML pages are text decuments, we usually seperate them into tiltle , head and body.
### Extra Markup
* The escape characcters are the  that are used in
and reserved by HTML code,  if you want these
characters to appear on your
page you need to use what are
termed "escape" characters . When using escape characters,
it is important to check the
page in your browser to ensure
that the correct symbol shows
up.( example :Less-than sign , Quotation mark, Multiplication sign,.. )
* when you statrt an HTML page , write DOCTYPES, it tells the browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
* when you add comments to your code use the "<!-- and -->" markers
* To identify particular elements , you can use The ID an Class attributes.
### HTML5 Layout
* HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure
* you need to tell the old browsers that HTML5 elements are block-level elements.
### Process and Design
before you start the HTML code , you shlould think how you want your website to look like, and who are the people you are targeting . you can do this by using a **site map** or a **Wireframe**. These helps you to plan the stucyure of the site, and to organize the information that will need to go on each page.

## Javascript

### The ABC Of Programming
* **What is a script?** A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
* **Design a script** first, you should sketch out the tasks in a flowchart.
* **How do computers fit in?** computers create models using data. Web browses use HTML markup to create a model, each element creats its own node (*object*)
* **How do I write a script?**  JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the **.js** extension.
